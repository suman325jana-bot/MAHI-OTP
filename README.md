# Mahi OTP - Starter Project

This is a starter skeleton for an OTP Rental / Virtual Number platform (Admin + User).
It contains a minimal backend and frontend scaffold, Docker compose, and example config.

## What's included
- backend/  -> Node (Express) starter files (demo)
- frontend/ -> React + Vite skeleton
- docker-compose.yml
- .env.example

This is a starter template. Extend and replace mocked pieces (providers, payments) with your real integrations.

## How to use
Unzip and follow README files inside `backend/` and `frontend/` for dev commands. You can run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
